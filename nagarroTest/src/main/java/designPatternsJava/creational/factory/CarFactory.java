/**
 * Factory pattern is most suitable where there is some complex object creation
 * steps are involved. To ensure that these steps are centralized and not
 * exposed to composing classes, factory pattern should be used. We can see many
 * realtime examples of factory pattern in JDK itself e.g.
 * 
 * java.sql.DriverManager#getConnection() java.net.URL#openConnection()
 * java.lang.Class#newInstance() java.lang.Class#forName()
